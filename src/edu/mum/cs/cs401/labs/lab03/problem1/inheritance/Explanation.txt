This is happening because p1 instance is created as a PersonWithJob object and p2 is created as Person object. 
Then, when equals method is called from p1 "p1.equals(p2)" this is using the overrided method in PersonWithJob class and 
this method is asking if the incoming object "p2" is an instance of PersonWithJob class but, p1 was not created as PersonWithJob instance.
