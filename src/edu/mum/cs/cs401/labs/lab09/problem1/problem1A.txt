Lab09 - Problem 1A

Stream.generate create an infinite stream, so in this case the stream is printing only one value, but it is still running.
To solve this, we can put a limit before the distinct method call.

public static void main(String[] args) {
	IntStream ones = IntStream.generate(() -> 1).limit(5).distinct();
	ones.forEach(System.out::println);
	
	System.out.println("Finish");
}
