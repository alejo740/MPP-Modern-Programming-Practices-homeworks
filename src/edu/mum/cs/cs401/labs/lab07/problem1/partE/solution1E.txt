Problem E:
	i.	When the type D is a Class, 
		A class can implement one or more interfaces. Furthermore, Type A, B, and C should be interfaces.
		In the case of the "method" method, if A and B classes have a default implementation for this method, then Class D SHOULD override the method 
		and specify which default implementation wish to call (i.e: ClassB.super.method();)
		But, if only one of the interfaces has default method, is optional to override the method in the Class D.
		In another case, where could be another method in an extended class with the same signature of the method from the interfaces, the method from class wins!

	ii.	When the type D is an interface.
		An interface can extends one or many interfaces, in this case the interface D can extends the interfaces B and C.
		In the case of the "method" method, if A and B classes have a default implementation for this method, then Class D SHOULD override the method 
		and specify which default implementation wish to call from their super types.
		But, if only one of the classes has default method, is optional to override the method.
