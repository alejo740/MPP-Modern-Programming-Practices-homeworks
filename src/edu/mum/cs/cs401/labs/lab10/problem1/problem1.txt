Lab10 - Problem 1

I think TDD is a very good practice in order to keep not only the quality of code but also to think what should be are the dependencies of this method.
During the practice of this point, I could notice during the development process of the Test, I had to think what I need to achieve the results, 
so I had to create the basis of other methods that work as dependencies. 

Another thing that I want to add is that during the development process of the Test, the developers can be focus working and testing on the specific 
methods or classes, without think in other environmental issues or dependencies of the whole project. 

To summarize, a class can be tested without building or running the whole project.
